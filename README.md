# Shor-s-Algorithm-Base-Range-Reduction-Symmetry-of-Successful-Bases
Reducing base range from N to N/2.

This repository contains my preprint “Shor’s Algorithm Base Range Reduction: Symmetry of Successful Bases.”

The note proves a simple but overlooked structural property of Shor’s algorithm: if a base a is successful, then its mirror N − a is always also successful with the same order. This symmetry implies that successful bases occur in pairs, and the effective search range for bases can be reduced to 1 < a < N/2 without any loss of probability.
